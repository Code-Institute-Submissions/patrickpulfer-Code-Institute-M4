## Project Requirements for Code Institute Full-Stack Software Development Diploma

## Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Project
- Build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.
- Set up an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service.
- Setup a e-commerce functionality by using Stripe payments
  <br>

## My approach

- I have taken inspiration from a real-life website called [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) where users can share ideas and discuss these ideas in a "forum"-style manner.

- In this document, I will attempt to explain the process I went through in thinking, planning and developing this project by utilizing industry-standard methodologies.

<br>

# UX Design

<br>
For this project, I've adopted the methodology of the five planes of UX, which consist of:

- Strategy
- Scope
- Structure
- Skeleton
- Surface Design

> ‚ÄúThe Elements of User Experience‚Äù book written by Jesse James Garrett, one of the founders of Adaptive Path, a user experience consultancy based in San Francisco.

<br>

## Strategy

### User Stories & Requirements

- Owner, Administrator:
    1. I want to offer a place where I can publicly share interesting stories/news/ideas
    2. I want other users to participate with ideas or share their opinion on my stories
    3. I want to offer a free service but also be able to monetize for exclusive member only content
    4. I want to customize my profile to include a short "Who am I" and ideally a profile picture

- End Users, site consumers:
    1. I want to share my ideas/opinions and have other users like me participate in the conversation
    2. I want to read other user's ideas and be able to participate in their conversation
    3. I want to at least read other user's ideas without having to login
    4. I want to have an exclusive club access, even if have to pay for it!
    5. I want to clutter or distraction, an intuitive forum that works on my PC, tablet and Phone

<br>

### Scope of this Project (based on owner and end user requirement/stories)

- To create an application that is accessible on mobile, tablet, laptops and desktops and is easy to navigate
- To create a website with uncluttered, logical and intuitive navigation which is easy to follow
- To store, manipulate, edit and delete (CRUD) data in a secure database, in this case Postgres
- To create a monetization strategy for exclusive member access
- To create an app (website) written with Django framework, ready to be deployed to Heroku

<br/>

### Structure

- Forum Page (Mobile first approach)
  - Top:
    - A navigation bar with Title and a "hamburger" menu if accessed by small screen devices. This menu will allow the user to visit their profile and login/logout
  - Central:
    - Forums are displayed as large boxes for intuitive navigation
    - "Concierge" Premium Forums are displayed first if user is part of the club
  - Bottom:
    Simple footer displaying Copyright and Credit of the app creator

- Discussion List Page (Mobile first approach)
  - Top:
    - A navigation bar with Title and a "hamburger" menu if accessed by small screen devices. This menu will allow the user to visit their profile and login/logout
  - Central:
    - Discussion Name and Description at the top, including a "Create new Post" button for logged users
    - List of all Discussion posts below, including the Title, the discussion body, link to it's creator and button to "view" the discussion
  - Footer:
    - Footer will display the Copyright and the credits for the app creator

- Discussion View Page (Mobile first approach)
  - Top:
    - A navigation bar with Title and a "hamburger" menu if accessed by small screen devices. This menu will allow the user to visit their profile and login/logout
  - Central:
    - Discussion picture on top, followed by the Title and the actual discussion post
    - At the end of the post, additional details like link to post creator, link to it's belonging forum and date of the post will be shown
    - If the logged user is also the creator, he may edit the post via button that appears at the end
  - Footer:
    - Footer will display the Copyright and the credits for the app creator

<br/>

### Skeleton

To be adhered to the structure outlined above, the following wireframes were drafted:

- End User Welcome Screen  
  <img src="./media/wireframe_mobile1.png" width="30%">

- End User Questions Card Screen  
  <img src="./media/wireframe_mobile2.png" width="70%">

- Admin Panel Screen  
  <img src="./media/wireframe_admin1.png" width="70%">

Note:

- Design has been implemented to draw the end user to the middle of the screen

<br/>

### Surface Design

To emphasize the origin of the project and the company behind it, the decision was made to include the colour scheme that would best match the colours in the existing logo:

- <img src="https://yourcoach.ie/resources/img/logos/logo_2020.png" width="5%">

Colour pallet:

- Main Colour (buttons & titles): <span style="color:#F3F0F1;background-color:#990011FF;"> #990011FF</span>
- Main background:<span style="color:black;background-color:#FCF6F5FF;">#FCF6F5FF</span>


<br>

## Testing

<br>

## Debug Logging

The application has been designed with debugging in mind. In your main application folder, you will find a file called `logs.log` which will contain similar information as below:

```

## Bug Testing (Site functionalities)

### Test 1 - Browser & Device Compatibility

- Main App has been tested with:
  - Chrome on Android
  - Safari on iOS
  - Microsoft Edge for Linux, Chrome & Firefox on Desktop
- Admin Page
  - Chrome on Android
  - Safari on iOS
  - Microsoft Edge for Linux, Chrome & Firefox on Desktop

### Test 3 - Errors at parsing HTML & CSS

- Website has been tested at https://validator.w3.org/nu/ & https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and showing no errors related to the app
- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ shows CSS errors specifically for external dependencies, which I can't resolve on my own

### Test 4 - End User Flow

1. Navigate to App URL (http://the-interview-master-deck.herokuapp.com/ for example)
2. Test swipe left:  
   <img src="./pictures/test_user1.png" width="20%">
3. Click on Start:  
   <img src="./pictures/test_user2.png" width="20%">
4. Swipe a few cards to the left and observe Cards being sorted randomly
5. Click on "Search" button:  
   <img src="./pictures/test_user3.png" width="20%">
6. Enter a keyword in the text box, in this case "leaving" and click "Search:"  
   <img src="./pictures/test_user4.png" width="20%">
7. Observe all cards being displayed with the selected word "leaving":  
   <img src="./pictures/test_user5.png" width="20%">

### Test 5 - Admin Login Flow

1. Navigate to the Admin Portal (http://the-interview-master-deck.herokuapp.com/admin as example)
2. Enter your admin credentials created earlier during setup (Admin:SuperSecret123! for the demo) and click Login:  
   <img src="./pictures/test_login1.png" width="50%">
3. Observe login being successfully and Python Flash displaying the following message:  
   <img src="./pictures/test_login2.png" width="20%">

### Test 6 - Admin Question Cards Creation and Deletion Flow

1. You should be logged into the Admin Portal
2. Click on "Cards" in your top navigation bar
3. On the right side of the screen, we will enter a test interview question as shown below:  
   <img src="./pictures/test2.png" width="80%">
