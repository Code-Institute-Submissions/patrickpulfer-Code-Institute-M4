### Steps for Application Server
- Heroku
  1. [Review official documentation for steps](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python)
  2. Create a Postgres database and note the URL you will need for your environment variables

### Application

  4. Post deployment setup requires you to download and execute [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install).
  5. In your Heroku CLI, run the following commands:
  ~~~bash
  heroku run python3 manage.py migrate
  ~~~
  6. Then create a super user with the following command and not the username and password:
  ~~~bash
  heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser
  ~~~
  7. Run the app in Heroku and navigate to the admin pannel, usually found by appending ```/admin/``` to your URL
  8. Next to "Products", click on "Add".
  9. Add a name for your premium forum access and enter your "Stripe Product ID" you've noted earlier.
  10. On the same page under Prices, click "Add another Price" and add the Price ID you've created earlier + the actual price (example 10â‚¬ would be ```1000```)
  11. All steps are done for deployment.

#### Alternative deployment (Directly to Linux Server)
  1. You may deploy the repo locally. The follow instructions below are for a Linux machine
  2. Create a folder where you want the App to reside and navigate to it in your command line
  3. Clone the App from GitHub:
  ```bash
  git init
  git clone https://github.com/patrickpulfer/code_insitute_m4.git .
  ```
  4. Create an environment variable file called .env and add the variables advised above.
  5. Install dependencies with PIP3:
  ```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  6. Run the initial setup for the database:
  ```bash
  python3 manage.py migrate
  ```
  7. Run the App
  ```bash
  python3 manage.py runserver
  ```
  Note: If you plan to deploy as an actual production server on Linux, you may want to look into [WSGI](https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what.html), [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) and a proper web server like NGINX.
